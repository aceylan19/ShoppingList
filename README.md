# ShoppingList
Program2: Shopping List

Features and Directions:
A text box at the top of the screen, to enter an element to add to the shopping list
When you press return on the keyboard, the item should be added to a list, that is displayed below the text entry box
You should be able to remove elements from the list by swiping or tapping.
Use the built-in widgets and APIs.  
You'll need to have an array of strings to hold the list information.  
If you get this done quickly, great features to add would be list rearrangement, and the ability to export the list as an email (or post to a web page, Twitter, etc.).
